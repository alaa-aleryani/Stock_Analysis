# VBA Challenge

In this challenge, we used VBA scripts effeciently to analyze the yearly stock data.


First, we printed each different ticker symbols just once. Then for each ticker we added the volumes for all corresponding tickers and printed the total. We calculated the yearly change and percent change for each different ticker. Finally, we looked for the greatest percent increase and decrease as well as the greatest total volume.  
Provided 3 screenshots, one for each year of the results and a vbs file which contains the code to run the calculations.
